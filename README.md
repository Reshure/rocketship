RocketShip
==========

RocketShip is an *extension* library for MoonScript. It contains a lot of helper functions to increase your productivity.

Why extend MoonScript?
-----------------------

Most of the time programming in MoonScript or Lua is spend on writing the *same* small functions over and over again because of the lack of any extensive standard library. The advantage of this is that the code runs *fast*, since it doesn't have to load entire modules containing many unnecessary code. RocketShip tries to fill the gap by providing a standard library with no loss in performance.

Using the **rocket** helper tool, you can select the functions *you* need for your project. Rocket then creates a file containing only those functions. There is no need to import unnecessary functions again. This keeps the core small, just like MoonScript itself.
